# Teaching Assistant Portal (TAP)

The Teaching Assistant Portal is a web-based system that simplifies the management of TAs for academic institutions. It allows teachers to efficiently select, assign, and monitor TAs from a pool of eligible students. Teachers can track TA performance, while TAs log their work hours, aiding in transparency and accountability.

The portal has specific modules for Teachers, Administrators, TAs, and Students. Teachers can select and propose TAs for approval, while Administrators manage the approval process. TAs can view assignments and log activities, and students can check eligibility and apply for TA positions.

The system is accessible via any web browser, using Python (Flask, FastAPI) for the backend, React/Next.js for the frontend, and MySQL for the database. It is designed for scalability, security, and flexibility. Key features include detailed reporting on TA activities, reducing administrative burden and enhancing performance assessments. Security measures like user authentication and secure data transmission ensure data protection, making the portal a reliable tool.
